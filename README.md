# HousePrices
Predicting house prices with Machine Learning

The goal of this project is to predict house prices, using 3 linear regression models of different complexity. 

The work is plit between 2 jupyter notebook. 
1) The first one is dedicated to the Exploratory Data Analysis and aims at establishing the preprocessing steps and feature engineering necessary to compute our models: https://github.com/ValSauArn/HousePrices/blob/main/house-prices-solution.ipynb 

2) The second one is dedicated to the machine learning part. A simple model with 2 features, a moderately complex model with at most 20 features and a complex model with all features are computed and the predictive performance of each are compared to one another as well as to a base model for benchmarking: https://github.com/ValSauArn/HousePrices/blob/main/house-prices-machine-learning.ipynb
